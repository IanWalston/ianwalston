### Ian Walston - Front-end focused full stack web developer

I am exactly where the human and computer meet each other.

It’s a pretty cool place to be.

I build web apps and APIs using ***javascript***. 

***Express*** in the backend, ***React*** in the frontend.

I believe anything can be achieved with the proper combination of science, technology, and motivated humans.
